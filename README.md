- 👋 Hi, my name is Alex and I'm a college student majoring in Computer Science at the University of Washington in Seattle! 
        I'm also minoring in Entrepreneurship and I have interest in the business side of tech. 
- 👀 I’m interested in mostly backend software development, as well as user experience! I would also love to one day take a Product Manager
        role to experiment with a more customer-facing role in tech. 
- 🌱 I’m a senior by credit standing, so I've taken courses such as Algorithms, Data Structures and Parallelism, etc. I'm signed up
        for a Human-Computer Interaction class for next quarter, and I'm super excited to learn more about UX from this course!
- 💞️ I’m quite new to open-source projects, but have some experience working on large projects with a group of people
        just from school experience. However, I'm excited to start collaborating with other Github users on a variety of projects.
        I'll most likely start with documentation or basic UX observations before I start contributing actual code, just to
        get the hang of using Github and brushing up on version control.
